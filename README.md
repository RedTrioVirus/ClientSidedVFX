# ClientSidedVFX

WIP

An easy way to make client-sided effects that also replicate to the server.

Features:
Particle Settings + Emits
Client-Sided Tweens
Client-Sided Bezier Curves
Client-Sided Cubic Curves *A







*A - Can have issues with replication, working to fix it, but it can be choppy atm.
